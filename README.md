Project Description
The Event Finder website helps users discover local events by searching for them based on a specific locality and date.The platform provides a seamless experience for users to view all relevant events happening in their area, helping them stay informed about nearby activities.

The Problem statement
In many localities, people often miss out on important or interesting events happening around them due to a lack of accessible, consolidated information. Tourists and locals alike struggle to find relevant events that match their interests, location, and timing.Additionally, event organizers face challenges in promoting their events to a wider audience.


The Solution
1. User-Facing Solution:
Search Functionality: Users can input a specific locality and date to quickly find all relevant events in their area on that date. This helps users avoid the hassle of searching multiple platforms or sources for local events.
2. Event Organizer Solution:
Event Submission: Event organizers can submit their event details 
3. Wide Reach: The platform provides organizers with greater visibility for their events, ensuring their events are seen by people
4. Tourism Relevance:
Tourism Integration: The platform is highly useful for tourists, who can search for events happening in the city they are visiting
